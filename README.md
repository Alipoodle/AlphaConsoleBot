AlphaConsole Discord Bot
===================


This is the official Discord bot for the [AlphaConsole Discord Server](https://discordapp.com/invite/alphaconsole). 
This bot serves the over 100k members we currently have in our Discord (2nd largest  worldwide).

What is AlphaConsole?
-------------
AlphaConsole is the largest 3rd party mod for the popular PC game Rocket League with over 100k users.

You can check out our site [here.](http://www.alphaconsole.net)

Unfortunately due to the nature of the program, most of AlphaConsole cannot be open source excluding the Discord bot in this repo.

### So what is this bot?

This bot is a re-write of our old C# Discord bot. It serves our server in many different ways. 

##### For our users:

 - Allows them to set a custom title in game

 - Responds automatically to commonly asked questions

##### For the AlphaConsole Staff
The bot helps the AlphaConsole staff with lots of different things. 
Some examples would be user database lookups, auto spam/swear word protection, custom  commands, warning, timed mutes, bans, kicks & way more than I want to list.

For a breakdown of all commands you can go to `src\cmds` 
For a breakdown of event calls you can go to `src\events`

### Contributing 

If you are interested in contributing to this project it will require some setup. 

You will need to edit `serverinfo.js` and fill in all the info with the server your testing on. 
Also required is an API key from discord which you can create [here.](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me)
Once you have a key you will need to put that into the `keys.js`.
